Introduction
------------

The listings service is used to register test assets for sale in a 
PaySwarm-compatible system. It is primarily provided as a way to 
help developers build new PaySwarm applications without having to
generate and host PaySwarm listings.

Typically, PaySwarm developers will upload listings to
http://listings.dev.payswarm.com/ to be used in applications under
development. These listings will then be utilized in test purchases.

Usage
-----

The design of the listing service is fairly simple and straight-forward.

To register a new listing:

   Mint a new URL on the server by POSTing a JSON-LD document to that
   URL. Use a prefix, such as a nickname or project as the base part
   of the URL.
   
To update a listing:

   POST a new JSON-LD document to a previously used URL.

To retrieve a listing:

   Perform a GET on a previously POSTed URL.

To remove a listing:

   Perform a DELETE on a previously POSTed URL.
